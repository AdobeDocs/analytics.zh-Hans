# 筛选计算量度列表

您可以筛选计算量度列表。 对计算量度使用筛选器可以更轻松地找到可用的计算量度，并通过[计算量度管理器](cm-manager.md)管理计算量度。


要筛选计算量度列表，请执行以下操作：

1. 选择![Filter](/help/assets/icons/Filter.svg)以打开筛选面板。如果“筛选”列表需要更多空间，您可以再次选择![Filter](/help/assets/icons/Filter.svg)来关闭该面板。
1. 从任何可用的[筛选器部分](#filter-sections)中选择筛选器。

## 筛选部分

{{tagfiltersection}}
{{reportsuitefiltersection}}
{{ownerfiltersection}}
{{otherfiltersfiltersection}}


[计算量度列表](cm-manager.md#filters-list)会根据您的筛选器配置自动更新。 您可以在[启用的筛选栏](cm-manager.md#active-filter-bar)中看到已配置的筛选。
